## Common issues

### No headsets online

When you select the headsets for trainees and the screen is empty, it means that there are no headsets online.
Check in the headset page if the headsets are online and if not, turn them on and start the EESP app.

:::tip
If the headsets tab is empty, it means that there are no headsets added to the system.
go to [add headset docs](../Headset/AddHeadset) to check how to add headsets to the system.
::: 

### No server available

When this happens, it means that there are no servers available.
This could be because all servers are already in use or because the servers are offline.

:::caution
If this keeps happening, restart the server computer.
:::

### Stuck on loading screen

This can happen when the server or headsets are not responding.
If the counter says `0/X` it means that the server is not responding.
If the counter says `Y/X` it means that on or more of the headsets are not responding.
Check the headsets and try to relaunch the training.
