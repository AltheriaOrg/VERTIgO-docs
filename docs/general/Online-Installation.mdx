title: Online Installation
---

This page will guide you through the installation steps for the online version of EESP. The online version connects to the EESP Console hosted on AWS at [https://vertigo.altheria.com](https://vertigo.altheria.com). Therefore, this setup requires internet connection to work. If your organization has strict security requirements you can install the EESP Console on your own infrastructure completely disconnected from the internet.

The online installation is by far the easiest and is recommended for most users.

# Step 1: Download the files
The Editor, VR Reader and Live Viewer will be distributed using a download link provided by Altheria. 


# Step 2: Run the Editor
Launch the EESP Editor .exe file and log in using your account. If you do not have an account yet you need to contact your organization administrator who will create your account.

The domain field is the address of the EESP Console you will be connecting to and does not need to be modified if you wish to use the online EESP Console.

To use the editor using a USB cable (tethered mode) you will need to use a Oculus Quest an install the Oculus software by pressing the "Download Software" button here. [https://www.meta.com/be/en/quest/setup/](https://www.meta.com/be/en/quest/setup/).

6. Press the "VR Preview" in the bottom left corner.
The editor can now be used using a headset in tethered mode (usb cable) without any more installation.


# Step 3: Install the EESP Reader on the headsets
The following instruction are only required so you can use the wireless headsets for trainings launched from the Console.
Connect the headsets to the computer using a USB cable. On the right panel of the editor it should say a headset is connected. If this is not the case, you might need to confirm a usb connection popup inside the VR headset. Put on the headset and reconnect the USB cable.

Press the **Install APK** button and select the .apk file that you downloaded. The installation process will begin and should not take longer than a couple minutes.
The **Connect Headset** button is used to set the EESP Console that the headset will use to the EESP Console the editor is currently using. This is only required if you want to switch the headset from the Online EESP to an Offline EESP console or the reverse.
