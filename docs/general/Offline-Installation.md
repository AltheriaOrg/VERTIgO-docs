This page will assist you in setting up the EESP software on your own infrastructure disconnected from the internet. This is the recommended method for organizations with stricter security requirements. 
This method is more complex and will require some technical knowledge about networking.
This page will provide an example of how to set up the software, but you are free to expand on this to fit the needs of your organization better.

# Requirements:
1. **A computer:** This computer will act as a server for the EESP Console and the multiplayer sessions.
2. **A WI-FI network:** This network does not need to be connected to the internet. The computer and headsets need to be connected to this network.
3. **A static IP address**: The IP address of the computer should remain the same. If the IP address changes, you will need to repeat some of the installation process to switch to the new IP address.

The online installation is by far the easiest and is recommended for most users.

# Example Setup
This section is a work in progress and will be available soon.
